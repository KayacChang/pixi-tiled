/**
 * @description
 * A tileset is a collection of tiles.
 * Tiled currently supports two types of tilesets, which are chosen when creating a new tileset:
 * - Based on Tileset Image: <br>
 *   This tileset defines a fixed size for all tiles and the image from which these tiles are supposed to be cut.
 *   In addition it supports a margin around the tiles and a spacing between the tiles,
 *   which allows for using tileset images that either happen to have space between or around their tiles
 *   or those that have extruded the border pixels of each tile to avoid color bleeding.
 * - Collection of Images: <br>
 *  In this type of tileset each tile refers to its own image file.
 *  It is useful when the tiles arenâ€™t the same size, or when the packing of tiles into a texture is done later on.
